### Version History

1. V1 - Getting Started

### Performance tips:

* You can turn down your render distance lower for Stoneblock than for other modpacks. You won't really notice until you get to the Nether, the End, or any other non-Overworld dimension.

### Seeds

# Uncategorized

* Veinminer is in this pack; rebind to a non conflicting key in settings to use.

* Hit a Chicken with a stick and killing it afterwards will give you an unbreakable, diamond-equivalent hammer called the Chicken Stick.

    * Note: This is an homage to the aggroed chickens from Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time and the strength of the chicken is comparable to those chickens. If you're unarmored and don’t have a good weapon, prepare to die several times in order to kill the aggroed chicken.

* Use a chicken stick when manually crushing cobble. It doesn't break, it spawns chickens, what more could you want?

* Veinminer works on trees, crouching bonemeals saplings, do both for quick wood.

* For early game fuel convert cobble into Stone Crafting Table then into the wooden version, then fuel up.

* For early-game players, build a mob farm as soon as possible. Loot bags are very important.

* Try and complete all the quests even if they have no use to you. The rewards can have big effects on your progress.

* Compressing gravel, sand, dirt, and dust (default 'k' in a 3x3 crafting grid) and using a heavy sieve will massively help your sieving pursuits

    * Sieving compressed blocks technically gives you 7 blocks worth of the uncompressed block's sieve loot. Sieve compressed blocks when you have a lot, sieve uncompressed when you’re scrounging for the drops.

* If you get something from a loot bag that finishes a quest, try and still get the item required manually so you have a way to generate it.

* Bonsai Pots are a gift from heaven for automating wood production. Hopping Bonsai Pots are even better.

* Three trees you want to set up in hopping bonsai pots (explained below): slime, apple, spectre (from random things)

    * Slime = slime blocks = amazing early power source in slime generator if you find a cow or just a cotem for infinite water.

    * Spectre = lots of cool early game wireless power without having to kill spirits magically

    * Apple trees = lots of wood and apples. Cooked apples are amazing early game food.

* The ultimate furnace is something you should aim to achieve as it helps a lot later on. Certain wands from loot bags help out tremendously. w-in-a-jar

        * Bonus: enderio tanks can suck up fluid from cow-in-a-jar and fill empty buckets passed into them

        * Bonus: Mechanical User (from Extra Utils) can milk a cow indefinitely and at great speeds

* The 'Sink' from Cooking for Blockheads is the best i

* The acceleration wand, paired with a growth crystal, means instant crops. 

* Cyclic has a scythe that can harvest all crops of all types within a single right click in a certain area. Pair this with the trick above and you can get a lot of crops very quickly.

* For early-game furnace fuel, you can convert cobblestone in your inventory into Stone Crafting Tables (hover over stacks of cobble, press "K"), and then convert those crafting tables into the wooden version in any crafting grid.

* Wearing an Enderman Head from Enderman Evolution will help you while in The End.

* A crusher can replace auto-hammers without needing a hammer.

* I will update this list as I play Keybinds are a ex mess. Veinminer and inventory recipe lookup are likely conflicting with something else.

* Ender tears can be thrown into a smeltery for four (or maybe eight?) ender pearls apiece. Use an emerald to make a gem cast for this. Try a pan cast first, it may work and is cheaper.

* Quantum batteries hold a ton of RF, charge things in your inventory, and are dirt cheap

* **Build a cobble compressor sooner than later, the mining dimension tool and deep dark portal take a lot of time to make.**

* Many passive mobs have a type of bait you can place in the world to spawn them.

* There are two types of markets you can build to buy seeds and spawn eggs with emeralds...use them.

* A compressed hammer breaks compressed cobble/gravel/dirt/sand/dust. and I will also add the helpful comments.

* Use an acceleration wand on the roost chicken breeder to get your chicken farm going, and invest in it early

* Push for the Ultimate Furnace, as nothing is faster.

    * Use Cyclic

* Don't bother with silk touch early game. Raw stone is slow to mine and doesn’t have many uses

* You can place sieves with the same meshes next to each other and they will automatically copy what you do with one.

    * Placing two sieves with string meshes adjacent to each other and then clicking on one with gravel, for example, will take two gravel but will sieve both.

    * This can be done with up to 25 meshes in a 5x5 grid. Make sure to click the middle sieve so that all of the material sieves at once

* For really early game infererium/set and forget crops/power : 2x lava Generator/fed by your good old yellorium block -> feeding 2 garden cloches (they are dead cheap) set to pumpkins & 1 Mekanism Crusher -> feeding 5 Biofuel Generators -> each of the generator can feed 17 cloches permanently -> use for your resource

* This one may be a bit dumb but the Not Enough Wands Acceleration Wand defaults to its *slowest* setting. Dig through your keybind options for a bit and you can change the mode.

* Growth Crystal's effect stacks, so if you get like a stack off of loot bags you can have all of your crops instantly growing, and your farm is now only limited in output by how fast your farmer can collect

* You can easily trap the wither under the portal home in the end, you can use this to get nether stars and supremium essence at a good rate as long as you have the soul sand and wither skeleton skulls.

* In case you don't want to take the time to make inefficient food, make the entire "Cooking for Blockheads" multi-block structure. It gives you instant food as long as you have the ingredients. It does take time getting all of the structures and blocks for it though.

* Cobblestone generator with a compacting drawer on top is literal infinite cobblestone if you have Tier V drawer upgrades.

## Early-game food sources

* Cooked/Baked Apples!!!

* Toasted Bread

* Pizza

* Epic Bacon is easy to get from quest loot bags

# Start of Stone Block

Real Early game goals 

1. Bonsai tree, six should sustain you; apples to cook 

2. Mob spawning/slaughtering area (loot boxes are op)

3. 5x5 sifting grid, only works with regular sifters

4. Cobble Generator v1	

# Power Generation

* You have *many* options for power but Ex Nihilo gives you unlimited lava (Tiny Progressions Cobblestone Generator into an Ex Nihilo Crucible). The Thermal Expansion Magmatic Dynamo, EU2 Magmatic Generator, and Mekanism's Heat Generator convert lava into power. 

* Loot bags provide Spectre Coils, blocks which provide 128 RF/t for absolutely no cost whatsoever. These can be useful for power.

* Epic Loot Bags have a chance to drop Spectre Coils which can be attached directly to machines throughout your base so you don't need wiring or extra Powercells.Mystical Agricultural

Rush tier 3 seeds for redstone plants for a sustained source of redstone, I've found that my sifting does not provide enough

# Storage

* Storage options are basically the same as most other modpacks. AE2 and/or RS for central mass storage, Storage Drawers, Iron Chests, Actually Additions Crates, Quantum Storage for deep storage and less demanding inventories, etc., etc.. 

* Actually Addition Crates are dirt cheap and massive

# Draconic Evolution

* TBA

# ProjectE

* TBA
